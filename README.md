# Project 3: Used Car Data Exploration and Visualizations

## by Betabasi Daniel


## Dataset

> Used Car Data is a large dataset of different types of used cars across the market gathered by a consulting firm based on various market surveys and the dataset can be obtained from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shubham1kumar/usedcar-data?select=UserCarData.csv). The dataset has 7906 entries of used cars with 18 features with data types of floats, integers and strings. Since the dataset needed to be wrangled and cleaned, I did it by splitting the torque column into two clolumns and then change the new columns to their appropriate datatypes before I started the exploration.


## Summary of Findings

> After my exploration, these were the findings I discovered from the dataset concerning the sales of the used cars.
> 1. About 25% of the total cars were sold leaving the remaining 75% unsold.
> 2. Among the four regions available, East region had the most sales followed by Central and West with South having the least sales.
> 3. Among the 49 states that were available in our dataset, 41 sates had records of used car sales and out of the 41 states New York happen to be the state that recorded the most sales followed by Carlifornia, Illinois and Texas while Nebraska happen to be the state with the least sales of used cars.
> 4. Among the 1310 cities recorded, 275 cities had records of used car sales and out of the 275 cities the city that has the most sales is New York City, followed by Los Angeles, Seattle and Chicago with Laredo being the 50th city on the list of cities with the most sales.
> 5. The fuel type used by most cars sold is Diesel followed by Petrol and LPG with CNG being the fuel type used by the least cars sold.
> 6. The percentage for the type of sellers recorded with the most sales are Individuals having 81% followed by Dealers having 15% while Trustmark Dealers having 4% are the least on the list.
> 7. Among the two type of transmission recorded, percentage for the type of transmission used by the cars with the most sales is Manual having 86% while cars with Automatic transmission having 14% has less sales.
> 8. The cars that sells most were the ones with first owner. I guess this is due to the condition these cars are at such ownership level as compared to the second, third and fourth above ownership level.
> 9. The variables that are significant in predicting the prices of used cars are the maximum power, torque, engine and distance covered by the used car. The greater the maximum power, torque and engine of the cars and the lesser the kilometers driven, the higher their selling prices and vice versa.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> The variables that are significant in predicting the price of a used car are maximum power, torque, engine, seats and kilometers driven respectively. The first four variables which are the maximum power, torque, engine and seats forms a strong correlation with the selling prices of cars as its increase contributes to the increase in the selling prices of cars. The last variable being kilometers driven happen to have the weakest correlation of all the car features but nevertheless, it still plays a vital role in determining the selling prices of cars due to the fact that the lesser the kilometers driven, the higher the selling prices of the cars and vice versa.

> The brands of cars that sells more have these in common. They mostly have manual transmission type, use either diesel or petrol as their fuel type and are sold by individuals. Maruti is the most sold brand, followed by Hyundai, Mahindra, Tata and Toyota respectively while Daewoo is the brand with the least number of sales recorded.

> Among the four regions available, East has the most sales, followed by Central and West with South having the least sales but despite the number of sales made by the four regions, the average selling prices of cars seems to be higher in the South and Central regions over the years. This indicates that cars are more expensive in the two regions as compared to the other two regions, East and West.
